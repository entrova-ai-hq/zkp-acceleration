## Slide 2: Motivation & Context
**Content:**
- "Confidential transactions demand fast, secure zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)."
- "zk-SNARKs: key to privacy in blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Zcash)."
- "Challenge: ZKPs are computationally intensive—CPU alone isn’t enough."
- "Solution: CPU-GPU collaboration on NVIDIA H100s."

**Visual**: Diagram of a confidential transaction (inputs → ZKP → verified output)

**🎯 Purpose**: Frame the problem and your solution, tailored to Nethermind's focus.

## Slide 7: TEE for Confidentiality (Test 3)
**Content:**
- "TEE-enabled H100s: secure proofs"
- "<5% PPS drop, <3 ms latency increase"
- "Confidentiality with minimal cost"

**Visual**: Stacked bar chart (TEE-On vs. TEE-Off, with latency overlay)

**🎯 Purpose**: Validate secure computation with low overhead.

---

## Slide 8: Energy Efficiency (Test 4)
**Content:**
- ">0.3 Proofs per Watt across 5 GPUs"
- "Power draw: <4000 W total system"
- "Sustainable scaling for large deployments"

**Visual**: Scatter plot (Power Draw vs. PPS; point size = PPW)

**🎯 Purpose**: Showcase practical, green deployment.

---

## Slide 9: Key Takeaways
**Content:**
- "H100 accelerates zk-SNARKs: 100–160 PPS, <50 ms latency"

## Slide 10: Call to Action & Q&A
**Content:**
- "Next steps: Optimize for larger circuits, deploy in production"
- "Collaboration: Exabits.ai (compute) + Nethermind (zk-SNARKs)"
- "Questions?"

**Visual**: Futuristic tech or NVIDIA GTC-style background

**🎯 Purpose**: End with an actionable pitch and invite engagement.

---

## 🎨 Design Tips
- **Theme**: Use NVIDIA’s green–black–white palette or modern tech aesthetics
- **Visuals**: Avoid 3D effects, use clean flat charts
- **Fonts**: Large and readable (20+ pt)
- **Axis Labels**: Clearly mark units (PPS, ms, W)

---

## ⏱️ Timing
- 1–1.5 minutes per slide
- Total talk time: 10–15 minutes
- Practice for concise, punchy delivery (ideal for GTC)

---

## 🧾 Handouts
- Provide a 1-pager with detailed charts (include GPU heatmap as bonus)
