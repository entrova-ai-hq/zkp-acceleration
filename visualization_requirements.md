zk-SNARK Performance Visualization Guide
Overview
This guide outlines how to visualize the performance of zk-SNARK proof generation across multiple GPU and TEE configurations. The goal is to support claims related to optimization, collaboration, and confidentiality using intuitive, impactful charts.

📊 Test 1: Bar Chart – Throughput Across GPU Configurations
🎯 Purpose: Show the scalability and throughput of zk-SNARK proof generation.

Chart Details:

X-Axis: Number of GPUs (3, 4, 5)

Y-Axis: Proofs per Second (PPS)

Bars: One set per batch size (e.g., 100, 500, 1000 proofs)

Annotations: GPU utilization % (e.g., >85%) above each bar

💡 Why It Works:

Demonstrates scalability (e.g., 1.6× PPS from 3 to 5 GPUs)

Highlights trade-offs with different batch sizes

🖼️ Example Caption:

Throughput (PPS) of zk-SNARK proof generation with varying GPU counts and batch sizes, showcasing near-linear scalability (e.g., 1.6× PPS from 3 to 5 GPUs).

📈 Test 2: Line Graph – Latency Breakdown of a Single Proof
🎯 Purpose: Illustrate end-to-end latency and CPU–GPU handoff efficiency.

Chart Details:

X-Axis: Proof generation stages (e.g., CPU Witness Prep, Data Transfer, GPU Computation)

Y-Axis: Time (ms)

Lines: Avg. time to final proof (TTFP, e.g., 20–100 ms), with error bars (e.g., <5% SD)

Highlight: Shade data transfer time (e.g., <5 ms)

💡 Why It Works:

Breaks down latency contributions to validate system efficiency

Useful for audiences focused on real-time performance

🖼️ Example Caption:

Latency breakdown of a single zk-SNARK proof, showing efficient CPU–GPU collaboration with minimal transfer overhead (<5 ms).

🧱 Test 3: Stacked Bar Chart – TEE vs. Non-TEE Performance
🎯 Purpose: Compare throughput and latency with and without Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).

Chart Details:

X-Axis: Configurations (TEE-Off, TEE-On)

Y-Axis: PPS (primary); Latency (ms) as a secondary axis

Stacks: PPS split into computation vs. overhead

Overlay: Line for latency

Annotations: Overhead % (e.g., <5–7% PPS drop)

💡 Why It Works:

Quantifies trade-offs between confidentiality and performance

Combines both throughput and latency in one figure

🖼️ Example Caption:

Performance impact of TEE on zk-SNARK proofs, with <5% PPS reduction and <3 ms latency increase, ensuring confidentiality with minimal cost.

🔵 Test 4: Scatter Plot – Energy Efficiency vs. Throughput
🎯 Purpose: Highlight power–performance trade-offs in zk-SNARK generation.

Chart Details:

X-Axis: Power Draw (Watts)

Y-Axis: Proofs per Second (PPS)

Points: One per GPU count (3, 4, 5); size = Proofs per Watt (PPW)

Trend Line: Optional to show scaling

💡 Why It Works:

Frames performance in terms of sustainability

Relevant for large-scale or green deployments

🖼️ Example Caption:

Energy efficiency of zk-SNARK acceleration, achieving >0.3 PPW across 3–5 H100 GPUs with stable scaling.

🔥 Optional: Heatmap – GPU Utilization Across Workload
🎯 Purpose: Visualize how work is distributed across multiple GPUs.

Chart Details:

X-Axis: Time (minutes) or Batch #

Y-Axis: GPU ID (1–5)

Color Scale: Utilization % (e.g., green >85%, red <50%)

💡 Why It Works:

Validates load balancing in parallel workloads

Adds insight into resource scheduling

🖼️ Example Caption:

GPU utilization heatmap during zk-SNARK proof generation, showing consistent >85% usage across 5 H100 GPUs.

🧠 Publication Strategy
Core Figures:

Required:

Test 1 – Throughput (Scalability)

Test 2 – Latency (Optimization)

Test 3 – TEE Impact (Confidentiality)

Optional:

Test 4 – Energy Efficiency: Include if space permits

Heatmap: Use only if parallelization is a key claim

🎨 Style Tips
Use consistent color schemes (e.g., blue = GPU, orange = CPU)

Use log scales when data spans multiple orders of magnitude

Ensure all axes are clearly labeled (PPS, ms, W)

Keep legends clean and accessible

🔄 Narrative Flow
Start strong with throughput (Test 1) to establish performance

Add detail with latency breakdown (Test 2)

Establish trust with TEE performance (Test 3)

End with impact via energy efficiency or parallelization (Test 4 or Heatmap)
