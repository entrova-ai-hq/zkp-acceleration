# zkp-acceleration
Optimized CPU–GPU collaborative acceleration of zero-knowledge proof for confidential transactions

**Test 1: Throughput of ZKP Generation (Transactions per Second)
Objective: Measure the rate at which ZKPs for confidential transactions can be generated using CPU-GPU collaboration.**

**Setup:**
Implement a ZKP protocol (e.g., zk-SNARKs or Bulletproofs) for a simplified confidential transaction (e.g., proving a transaction amount is within a valid range without revealing it).
Use 3-5 H100 GPUs in parallel, with the CPU handling preprocessing (e.g., witness generation) and GPUs accelerating the proof computation (e.g., FFTs, elliptic curve operations).
Generate a dataset of 10,000 transactions to process.
Execution:
Run the workload with varying batch sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1000 transactions per batch) across the GPUs.
Distribute tasks: CPU prepares inputs, GPUs compute proofs concurrently.
Metrics:
Transactions per Second (TPS): Total transactions processed divided by runtime (target: 100-500 TPS depending on batch size and complexity).
GPU Utilization (%): Measure via NVIDIA tools (e.g., nvidia-smi) to verify efficient load distribution (target: >80% utilization per GPU).
Scalability: Compare TPS with 3 vs. 5 GPUs to assess linear scaling (e.g., ~1.6x TPS increase).
Time Estimate: ~1.5-2 hours (including setup and multiple runs).

**Test 2: Latency of Single ZKP Computation (Time to First Proof)
Objective: Evaluate the end-to-end latency of generating a single ZKP, emphasizing CPU-GPU handoff efficiency.**

**Setup:**
Use the same ZKP protocol as Test 1.
Configure one H100 GPU paired with a high-performance CPU (e.g., AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon with TEE support).
Simulate a single confidential transaction proof.

**Execution:**
Measure time from transaction input to proof output, with CPU handling initial setup and GPU performing the heavy cryptographic computation.
Repeat 50-100 times for statistical reliability.

**Metrics:**
Time to First Proof (TTFP): Average latency in milliseconds (target: 50-200 ms depending on proof complexity).
CPU-GPU Transfer Overhead (ms): Time spent transferring data via PCIe (target: <10% of TTFP).
Consistency (Standard Deviation): Variability in TTFP across runs (target: <5% deviation).
Time Estimate: ~1 hour (quick runs, minimal data volume).

**Test 3: Performance Impact of TEE for Confidentiality
Objective: Assess the overhead of enabling TEE on the H100 GPUs for secure ZKP computation.**

**Setup:**
Enable TEE mode on 3 H100 GPUs (CC-On mode with encrypted CPU-GPU data transfers).
Use the same ZKP workload as Test 1, processing 5,000 transactions.
Compare with TEE-off mode as a baseline.
Execution:
Run the workload twice: once with TEE enabled, once disabled.
Use bounce buffers and remote attestation to ensure confidentiality.
Metrics:
TPS Overhead (%): Percentage drop in TPS with TEE enabled (target: <7% based on prior H100 benchmarks).
Latency Increase (ms): Additional time per proof due to encryption (target: <5 ms).
Memory Bandwidth Utilization (GB/s): Measure via NVIDIA profiling tools (target: >50% of H100’s 3 TB/s HBM3 bandwidth).
Time Estimate: ~2-2.5 hours (two full runs with setup).

**Test 4: Energy Efficiency of CPU-GPU Collaboration
Objective: Quantify the power efficiency of ZKP acceleration across multiple H100 GPUs.**

**Setup:**
- Use 5 H100 GPUs running the Test 1 workload (10,000 transactions).
- Monitor power draw with NVIDIA tools (e.g., NVML API or nvidia-smi).
- Pair with a CPU supporting TEE (e.g., AMD EPYC with SEV-SNP).

**Execution:**
- Process the workload at maximum throughput for 30 minutes.
- Record power consumption and transaction output.

**Metrics:**
- Transactions per Watt (TPW): Transactions processed per watt of power (target: 0.5-1 TPW).
- Total Power Draw (W): Average power across CPU and GPUs (target: <4000 W for 5 GPUs + CPU).
- Efficiency Scaling: Compare TPW with 3 vs. 5 GPUs (target: minimal drop-off).
- Time Estimate: ~1-1.5 hours (single run with monitoring).

**Practical Considerations**
- Time Management: Total estimated time is 5.5-7 hours, fitting the availability window. Prioritize Tests 1 and 3 if time is constrained, as they directly address throughput and confidentiality.
- Software: Use CUDA 12.4+ for H100 support, with libraries like cuFFT and cuBLAS for ZKP math. Implement ZKP using an open-source framework (e.g., libsnark or bellman).
- Verification: Log all metrics with timestamps and GPU states. Cross-check TPS and latency with theoretical H100 performance (e.g., 130 TPS for medium-sized tasks from prior studies).
- Hardware Assumptions: Assumes access to a system with 3-5 H100 GPUs (e.g., DGX H100) and a compatible CPU with TEE support.

**Expected Outcomes**
- Test 1: 100-200 PPS with near-linear scaling, reflecting Nethermind’s optimization expertise.
- Test 2: TTFP <50 ms, showcasing tight CPU-GPU integration.
- Test 3: TEE overhead <5%, aligning with confidential transaction needs.
- Test 4: PPW >0.3, proving energy-efficient acceleration.
